### üëã Hi, I'm Ayrton 

<br>

I'm a PhD student working within the Energy Systems & AI Lab at the UCL Energy Institute, my research focuses on new techniques for forecasting electricity prices and wind power to aid in optimisation of wind farm operation. Before starting my PhD I received a bachelors in Chemical Engineering and masters in Energy Systems & Data Analytics. Alongside my research I help teach statistics, programming, and GIS to masters students at the UCL Energy Institute.

### Portfolio

I'm particularly excited by the growing volumes of energy data being made available and build tools to help others access it easier. To this end I've developed a number of Python libraries for downloading data from Octopus Energy, the UK National Grid, and BMRS - alongside smaller one-off notebooks for accessing other data sources.

I've built several energy related websites for my own projects, external clients, and a multi-university energy journal. The majority of websites I work on use Flask or Django in the back-end but I also dabble in NodeJS, Laravel and CMS like Drupal. Currently most of my personal projects are related to model or data serving through Flask or FastAPI.
